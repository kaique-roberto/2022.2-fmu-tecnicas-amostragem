About Dataset

Overview
Social programs like Bolsa Familia were responsible for nearly 60 percent of the reduction in the number of people living in extreme poverty during the boom decade, according to Emmanuel Skoufias, lead economist in poverty and equity global practice at the World Bank.

However, while job losses have been pushing more families toward the program, Bolsa Familia coverage has been declining. An Associated Press review of Bolsa Familia data found that coverage declined 4 percentage points between May 2016, when Temer became president, and May of this year.
